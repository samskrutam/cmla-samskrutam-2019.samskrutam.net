# Trimister - 2 :  Week - 1


## पठनम्

अं to औं ( Concept of अनुस्वाराः with  स्वराः )

Use the file: [अं to औं .pdf](/resources/trimister-2/week-1/अं - औं.pdf)

The students should know that the dot at the top of a given vowel would mean “म्” and that sound with the vowel is called अनुस्वारः । अं to औं are अनुस्वार-युक्त-स्वराः ।

Explain that the अनुस्वारः comes ONLY with vowels and not consonants

## लेखनम्

Teacher can make the students write all the “अनुस्वार-युक्त-स्वराः” in their notebooks. Teacher also can give some words and see if the students can recognize the “अनुस्वार-युक्त-स्वराः”
Ex: भूमिम्, रामम्, देवीम्, गवाम्, वधूम्, etc.

## भाषणम्

Print the document: [वर्णाः document.pdf](/resources/trimister-2/week-1/वर्णा - document.pdf) to the students. वर्णाः are not available in अयनम्। Hence the students need the papers.

Use the file: [वर्णाः pictures.pdf](/resources/trimister-2/week-1/वर्णाः - pictures.pdf) to show the colors. Also if the teacher can take color papers of various colors mentioned in the document, that is also good enough to teach the colors. Also if the teacher has color (artificial) flowers, the teacher can use them. If no props are available, then use the file to show the colors in the class.
In the document, let the students color the box ( 2nd column ) with the color mentioned for that row.

### Teaching अस्ति , नास्ति

Use the following two examples:

रिक्त कूपी/ जलसहितकूपी

जल-सहित-कूपी ===== जलम् अस्ति + कूपी अस्ति 
रिक्त-कूपी ===== कूपी अस्ति , जलं नास्ति

रिक्त-पेटिका / अङ्कन्या पेटिका

अङ्कन्या पेटिका ===== पेटिका अस्ति + अङ्कनी अस्ति 
रिक्त-पेटिका ===== पेटिका अस्ति , अङ्कनी नास्ति

### Teaching Sight words अस्ति , नास्ति

The sight words are taught so that kids would not read them. Instead they recognize them immediately and able to read faster. The kids are learning अक्षराणि at this point which they would read using what they are learning in the class. However, with the sight words, they would look at the word and just remember the pattern and read them.

In this fashion, the kids can start reading sentences like
करः अस्ति । गजः अस्ति । मनः अस्ति । चटकः नास्ति । etc.

Make flash cards for each child for the sightwords and let them put it in a ziplock or so, so that they would practice them at home

Use the file [Level 1 Sight words.pdf](/resources/trimister-2/week-1/Level 1 Sight words.pdf) to print the pdf..
Print 4 pictures per page so that they can be cut and made flash cards. Make sure each child has 1 set of flashcards
